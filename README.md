# Aeroscape
Aeroscape is a 2D grid-based game developed by Team 2 for our Object Oriented Java class (CS 321). The game is inspired by Factorio and features material collection, placeable structures, and enemy encounters.

# Gameplay
In Aeroscape, players explore a grid-based world and gather materials to build structures and weapons to defend against enemies. Each grid acts as a container to an object, making strategic placement of structures and defenses crucial for survival.

The game is heavily inspired by Factorio, a popular factory building game, and includes similar mechanics such as automated machines for production.
