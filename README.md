# Aeroscape

Aeroscape is a 2D grid-based game developed by Team 2 for our Object Oriented Java class (CS 321). The game is inspired by Factorio and features material collection, placeable structures, and enemy encounters. In Aeroscape, players explore a grid-based world and gather materials to build structures and weapons to defend against enemies. Each grid acts as a container to an object, making strategic placement of structures and defenses crucial for survival.

## Getting Started Tutorial
1) Open NetBeans and open the <code>/Aeroscape/</code> project
2) To ensure performance with minimal errors, first select <code>Clean and Build Project (Shift+F11)</code> under the 'Run' tab
3) After cleaned and built, run the project (usual NetBeans run command or F6)
4) Here you can select <code>settings</code> (to modify audio settings) or <code>New Game</code> to start a new save
5) After selecting <code>New Game</code> enter a username in the lower text box which appears and select <code>Next</code>
6) Select your desired map size
7) Now, in game, you can move with <code>W, A, S, D</code>
a) Left click on resource tiles to place Miners which will gather the resource of a given tile
b) Right click on a grass tile to place a Smelter which will convert raw resources with coal to produce ingots
c) Middle click on a grass tile to place a SAM_PLATFORM (currently not functioning)
8) The game (as of 4/21) cannot be saved so exiting the game is possible only by closing the window
